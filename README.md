# Project Title

## Overview

This project uses a robust and scalable microservices architecture to deliver a powerful e-commerce application. The system is primarily built using NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.

The key technologies and services used in the project are:

- **EventstoreDB Cluster**: EventstoreDB is a robust data store for event-sourced systems. It allows us to manage the state of our application by saving each state change as an event in a log. This approach offers high performance and consistency for our application data.

- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL is our primary relational database management system. We use it to store all transactional data that is not suitable for an event-based system, such as user accounts and order details.

- **PgAdmin4**: PgAdmin4 is a comprehensive PostgreSQL database management GUI. It offers a visual interface to our PostgreSQL database, simplifying database management and query operations.

- **NestJS**: NestJS serves as the backbone of our application. We use it to build a high-performance API Gateway, manage our microservices, and handle all server-side logic. In addition, we've implemented a custom EventstoreDB transport layer and client within our NestJS application to facilitate communication between the microservices and the EventstoreDB.

- **Elasticsearch**: Elasticsearch is our primary search engine. It allows us to offer advanced search capabilities to our users, such as full-text search and filterable search results.

- **Strapi4 PostgreSQL**: Strapi is a headless CMS that we use as our time-to-market query engine. It also provides us with a data dashboard that offers sortable, searchable, and filterable tables. This simplifies data analysis and helps us make data-driven decisions.
